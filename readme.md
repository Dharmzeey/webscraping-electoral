# webscraping-electoral
This was used to extract all the voting wards, their lga and the state that are in Nigeria as at 2022 from INEC website

First install selenium and the desired driver (I used chromedriver)

Note this code is with the Selenium 2022 documentation and also with the respective website configuration of 2022, there may be few changes to the elements on the websites which will affect the xpath (necessary adjustments might be needed)

### To get the full list and information of the electoral ward as available on the sites in 2022

+ open the details_csv.csv

### To run the scripts for scraping

+ open the app.py and run
